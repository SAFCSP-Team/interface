# Interface

**Objective**

In this project, we will learn an interface specifying a class behavior by providing an abstract type.

**Problem**

Calculate the area of the geometrical shape Using the Interface concept.

**Implementation**

* Create an interface named `Shape` which should contain only one method called `calculateArea()`.
* Create `Rectangle` and `Circle` classes that implement the Shape interface and provide their implementations for the calculateArea() method.

```Java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       /* write your code here */
    }
}

```
