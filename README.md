**Problem**

Calculate the area of geometrical shapes Using Interface concept.


**Implementation**

* Create an interface Shape that declares a single method calculateArea().
* Create multiple classes that implement the Shape interface and provide their own implementations for the calculateArea() method.

```Java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       /* write your code here */
    }
}

```
