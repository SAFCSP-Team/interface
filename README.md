# Interface

**Objective**

In this project, you will learn how to use interfaces in Java to define a contract that specifies the methods a class must implement without providing the implementation.

**Problem**

Calculate the area of the geometrical shape Using the Interface concept.

**Implementation**

* Create an interface named `Shape` which should contain only one method called `calculateArea()`.
* Create `Rectangle` and `Circle` classes that implement the Shape interface.
* Overload the `calculateArea()` method in each class.
* In the main method , create an object from each class and return the result of `calculateArea()` method, and print it.

```Java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       /* write your code here */
    }
}

```
